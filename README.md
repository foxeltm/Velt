# [Velt Game Engine](https://Velt.tech)

 Velt is a 2D/3D Game Engine powered by Vulkan and inspired by Game Engines Like [Hazel](hazelengine.com), [Unity](uinty.com) and the [Source](vavtesoftware.com) Engine. The Editor and Debug UI are going to be powered by Dear IMGui or Walnut. 

Currently its just me working on Velt but everyone can Contribute for now. Velt right now is Licensed under Apache-2 License but we might switch to another License
